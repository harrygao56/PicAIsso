It begins with prophase, where chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the nuclear membrane begins to break down as the mitotic spindle forms. During metaphase, the chromosomes align along the cell's equator, known as the metaphase plate, with spindle fibers attached to their centromeres. In the anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers, moving toward opposite poles of the cell. Finally, during telophase, the separated chromatids reach the poles, and new nuclear membranes form around each set, leading to the de-condensation of chromosomes back into chromatin. The process concludes with cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two distinct daughter cells, each containing an identical set of chromosomes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "diagram"}]}
